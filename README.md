## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Deployment Methods

This project is intended to be deployed to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). There are several ways to deploy Laravel app to AWS Lambda.

-   The first and easiest method is using [Serverless PHP - bref](https://bref.sh/). Bref is a composer packages that uses [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) to helps you deploy PHP-based applications to AWS and run them on AWS Lambda.
-   Another method is using [aws-lambda-web-adapter](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter) with [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html).

**Please check out each branch of this repository to learn more about each deployment.**
